/*Gene: a city (represented as (x, y) coordinates)

*Individual (aka “chromosome”): a single route satisfying the conditions above
*
*Population: a collection of possible routes (i.e., collection of individuals)
*
*Parents: two routes that are combined to create a new route
*
*Mating pool: a collection of parents that are used to create our next population (thus creating the next generation of routes)
*
*Fitness: a function that tells us how good each route is (in our case, how short the distance is)
*
*Mutation: a way to introduce variation in our population by randomly swapping two cities in a route
*
*Elitism: a way to carry the best individuals into the next generation
*
*Our GA will proceed in the following steps:
1. Create the population
2. Determine fitness
3. Select the mating pool
4. Breed
5. Mutate
6. Repeat
